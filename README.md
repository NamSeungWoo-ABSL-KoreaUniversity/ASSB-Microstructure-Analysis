# ASSB-Microstructure-Analysis
Official implementation of the paper: "Unlocking the performance limits of composite electrodes in all-solid-state batteries through packing theory-guided design" (Currently Under Review)

## Examples (Quick Start)

This repository provides two **example workflows** for (1) microstructure analysis and (2) DEM-based electrode microstructure generation.

> The included examples are provided **only for fast demonstration and result verification**.

---

### 1) Microstructure Analysis (Example Code)

This example demonstrates how to run microstructure image analysis using a **pre-trained model weight (`.pt`)** and a **sample input image**.

#### Contents
- **Model weight (`.pt`)**: available via a download link under the [`weights/`] folder.
- **Example code**: [`example_code_microstructure_analysis.ipynb`]
- **Example image**: [`example_image/`] (use as a workflow input image)
- **Example results**: results generated by running the code on the provided `example_image`

> Note: The actual filenames/folders may differ slightly depending on your local setup.

#### Before running
1. Download the **weight file** from the link in [`weights/`] and place it under the `weights/` directory.
2. Download/prepare the **example image** and place it under [`example_image/`].

#### Running the notebook
1. Open [`example_code_microstructure_analysis.ipynb`]
2. In **Cell 1**, set:
   - the local path to the downloaded **weight file**
   - the local path to the **example image**
   - the **output/save directory** path (where results will be stored)
3. Run the notebook cells in the notebook.

#### Reference outputs
The [`example_results/`] folder contains reference outputs generated by running the code on the provided example image, so you can compare your results.

### 2) DEM & Microstructure Generation (Example Code)

#### Instructions: Running the Example Code
Please **run only the last cell** in the notebook:

- [`Example_DEM and Microstructure generation.ipynb`]

#### Steps
1. Open `Example_DEM and Microstructure generation.ipynb`.
2. Scroll to the **final (last) cell**.
3. **Run only that last cell.**

#### Output path 
In the last cell, you must set the **output/save path** to match your local environment (your own computer).

- Update the save directory to a valid path on your machine before running.
- Make sure the target folder exists (or that the code creates it).
